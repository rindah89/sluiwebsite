We need students who can integrate the knowledge and methods of specific fields - whether health sciences, business or natural sciences learned from St. Louis University classrooms, fields and laboratories - into a toolkit for problem solving that will be adapted and applied across disciplines and settings. How do we nurture such brazen creativity? By providing settings for cross-disciplinary learning to take place - we give students permission and encouragement to color outside the lines, they learn how to think outside the box.",

    "while": "While immersing ourselves in our mission, we have learnt that so much learning happens beyond the campus green. When students immerse themselves directly in the communities and issues they study they not only understand the problems and possibilities differently, but also develop a critical quality for change making: Empathy. Whether through courses that take students into communities or through community engagement programmes on campus, immersion can easily be integrated into or isolated from the classroom so long as students find proper spaces of preparation and reflection. An example is our partnership with organizations and educators that inspire our students that will prepare them to design and lead a project in collaboration with a grassroots development organization. As universities, we must continue to increase these opportunities for students to immerse themselves in the world without a syllabus.",
    "innovation": "Innovation:",
    "innovation1": "Encourage, prepare, and expect students to gain expertise, breadth, values, and practical experience necessary to achieve individual fulfillment and to help solve problems that challenge communities everywhere",
    "innovation2": "This message has never been more meaningful or critical. As it pertains to St. Louis objectives and mission. The intricacy and immediacy of global challenges we face require that universities re-connect and re-commit to these ideals by providing students with not only the acquisition of knowledge but the tools for action as well. At St. Louis University campuses and facilities around the country, we have been working to build the ecosystems - courses, programmes, internships, coaching and mentorship Programmes - within and in collaboration with external experts and organizations. Students need well-designed and supportive learning experiences through which they can translate ideas into action. We are pledged to give our students the chances to test ideas, fail occasionally (through risks that are calculated and respectful), and learn from things that don't work. The emphasis in these experiences is designed to be on empowerment, rather than earning good grades through perfect planning and execution. This dynamic shall occur between faculty/adviser and student, or peer-to-peer, through unique course exercises, projects or entrepreneurial venture support. We are poised therefore to deliver (and convinced that doing so shall position us at the peak of excellence in academia) to deliver excellence in our mission through exploration, immersion, and innovation, and provide the next generation of leaders with the knowledge and tools to make powerful connections that better our world."
